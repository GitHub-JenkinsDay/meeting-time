Then click on notifications
    _click on notifications_

You’ve got several choices around how much and when you’re notified.

Clicking the Automatically Watch box means you’ll get a notification whenever someone grants you access to a repository.

You can tell GitHub to send you notifications when there’s activity in conversations you’re participating in here.

Choose whether you want to receive email, read you notifications on the GitHub page, both, or neither

Same things for repositories you’re watching (more about that in a bit)

You can use the email notification preferences to further filter any notifications sent to you by email.

Generally I filter out my own notifications, but your workflow is up to you!

#### Searching

Git doesn’t have any notion of a built in search.  It doesn’t need one, because it runs on your machine on a filesystem that has it’s own searching capabilities.

GitHub hosts many repositories, and also metadata like issues and pull requests.  Fortunately it also has a very powerful search engine that helps you find the stuff you’re interested in.

    _click GitHub enterprise icon_
    _switch context back to admackbar_

If I click on the GitHub icon, my search context will be the entire repository…

Let’s see what I get when I search for ‘meeting-time’

    _search for meeting-time_

Looks like there’s a lot of stuff relevant to meeting-time.

On the left is the search summary.  There’s 22 separate repositories that contain meeting time either in their name or in the code they contain

There’s a few commits (more on those later)

And plenty of issues.

Click a category to filter the search results view

    _click through categories_

You can also further filter by programming language

    _click Javascript_

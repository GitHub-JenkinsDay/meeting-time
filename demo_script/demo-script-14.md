To finish up, let’s take a look at some organizations that have implemented repositories that really show off how GitHub

     _navigate to Atom_

Atom is an open source, hackable editor sponsored by GitHub.

     _click on the atom repo_

As you can see, this is quite a busy project
If there are any of you in the room who are responsible for managing/monitoring what’s going on with development teams, GitHub has some useful tools for you.
     _click on Pulse_
Pulse, for example, provides a snapshot of all the activity that’s taken place in a repository over a period of time

How many Pull Requests have been merged? Simple, right here.
How many Releases?
What’s our ratio of open to closed issues?
How many Pull requests are lingering in the open state?

Whose contributing the most?

     _click Period dropdown, select Month_

and how do these trends change over time?
     _click on Graphs_
Graphs provide more detail
allowing us to drill down into the activity of individual contributors, including defunkt, who is GitHub’s CEO
     _click commits_
Commits helps you to keep your finger on the pulse of activity in a project across time
     _click codeFrequency_
Likewise see how much code is being added/deleted.  What’s up with the big spike in late 2014? Major refactoring that didn’t get into the scrum? LOL
     _click PunchCard_
You can even track activity by time.  Are your teams working odd hours? Working too much?

Let's take a look at how you can use GitHub to manage assets other than code.

  _click atom, click flight-manual.io_

The atom project uses GitHub to manage their documentation.  That's right, you can use the same
collaborative features we've just learned about to manage just about anything.  In fact, we
use GitHub to run GitHub at GitHub.  Folks who work in sales, marketing, documentatin, even legal,
who have never written a line of code in their lives are using GitHub all day, every day to do their jobs.

These guys are using the GitHub pages feature, which automatically builds and deploys their documentation to a web page

any way to import tasks/user stories etc. for

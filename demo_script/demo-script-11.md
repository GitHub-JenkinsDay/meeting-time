We’ll push our changes on branch featureA to the remote origin

    _git push origin featureA_

Looks good!  Now let’s go see what the effect on GitHub was…

    _switch to GitHub_

There’s a notification of our most recent commit…

  _click code tab_

But wait, the README.md file doesn’t reflect our changes!

that’s because we’re looking at the master branch.

switch to the new featureA branch to see all your changes

    _switch to featureA branch_

That’s better.

So what exactly was Git doing there?  What's staging mean?

Let's take a moment to review how Git actually works with files.

#### Git workflow

Switch back to slides

#### Pull Requests

Time to close the loop and merge our changes into master

    _switch to GitHub_

    _click on New Pull Request_

Fill in the details

To reflect awesomeness!

Then create the pull Request

  _click Create Pull Request_

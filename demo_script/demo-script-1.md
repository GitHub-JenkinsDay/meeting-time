### Demo Script

    _Sign in to octodemo.com as admackbar_

#### Dashboard
OK, let's get to know GitHub a little bit

I'll log into GitHub as Admiral Ackbar, a dev lead at rebelware.

  _login as admackbar_

First, a little background...  I've setup an organization on my instance of GitHub
Enterprise called rebelware, a feisty little startup dedicate to creating the best
software in the galaxy.

The first thing you see upon logging in is your dashboard.  This is a handy collection
of relevant information and events.

This includes:
 - Places you’ve been @mentioned (more on that later)
 - Activity in repositories you’re watching or contributing to
 - Activity in conversations you’re participating in

 _click issues_

 - At the top of the page you can easily access Pull Requests and issues that you either created, were mentioned in, or were assigned to

#### Notifications

You can setup GitHub to send you notifications when events occur that you might be interested in…

If you have unread notifications, you’ll see the bell icon with a blue dot

    _click the notifications icon_

Notifications are grouped by repository.

Click on one to view it

    _click on notification_

GitHub can generate a LOT of notifications, so managing them to suit your personal workflow is important.

To do so, just click on your profile icon
    _click on profile icon_

Click on ‘Settings’
    _click on settings_
